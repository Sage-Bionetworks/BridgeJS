<h3>Risks, Discomforts, and Inconveniences</h3>

<p>There are risks, discomforts, and inconveniences associated with any research study. These deserve careful thought.

<p>This is an observation study not a treatment study and we do not expect any medical side effects from participating.

<p>Inconveniences associated with participation include spending approximately 20 minutes per week to respond to notifications from the study application.

<p>Some survey questions may make you feel uncomfortable. Know that the information you provide is entirely up to you and you are free to keep questions blanked.

<p>Other people may glimpse the study notifications and/or reminders on your phone and realize you are enrolled in this study. This can make some people feel self-conscious.

<p>Be safe&mdash;just as you would not text while driving, do not fulfill study tasks while driving. Wait until you are in a safe place to perform tasks!

<p>You may have concerns about data security, privacy and confidentiality. We take great care to protect your information, however there is a slight risk of loss of confidentiality. This is a low risk because we separate your personal information (information that can <u>directly</u> identify you, such as your name or phone number) from the research data to respect your privacy. However, even with removal of this information, it is sometimes possible to re-identify an individual given enough cross-reference information about him or her. This risk, while very low, should still be contemplated prior to enrolling.

<p>Data collected in this study will count against your existing mobile data plan. You may configure the application to only use WiFi connections to limit impact on your data plan. You may respond to the surveys via the web portal instead of via your mobile phone but all the tasks must be completed using your mobile phone.

<p>Participation in this study may involve risks that are not known at this time.

<p>You will be told about any new information that might change your decision to be in this study.

<h3>Potential Benefits</h3>

<p>The goal of this study is to create knowledge, which benefits us as a society. The benefits are thus primarily the creation of insights to help current and future patients with PD better detect, understand and manage their health. We will work to return the insights to you by sending notifications to the mobile application for the study as those insights are validated. But these insights may not be of direct benefit to you. We cannot, and thus we do not, guarantee or promise that you will personally receive any direct benefits from this study. However you will be able to track your health and export your data at will to share with your medical doctor and anyone you choose.

<h3>Costs</h3>

<p>There is no cost to you for participating in this study other than to your mobile data plan if applicable.

<h3>Alternatives</h3>

<p>Since no medical treatments are provided during this study there are no alternative therapies. The only alternative is to not participate.
