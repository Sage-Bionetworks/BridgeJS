                    <p>Thank you for performing the speech tasks! We used the data collected from you to research speech changes in people with Parkinson&rsquo;s. Some 90 percent of people with Parkinson&rsquo;s experience changes in their speech. They tend to speak softly, even though to them it feels as if they are speaking at a normal volume. Additionally, people with Parkinson&rsquo;s often speak in a monotone, and their voices can get hoarse. As the disease progresses, they may articulate words less precisely or develop a tremor in the voice.</p>
                    <p>This data will help us determine non-pharmacological and non-surgical intervention to hopefully improve oral and other communications in individuals with PD.</p>
